This is Great Your Own Gatsby, an independent project I worked on in my junior year of high school. At the time, the class was reading The Great Gatsby, so I decided to make an interactive game to test knowledge on the book. It was created with C++ and the DirectX 9 API, which since I had not taken any formal programming classes at the time, were both self-taught with books and online resources.

It is a choose your own adventure type game in which if one makes the choices that don't align with the actual plot of the book, funny events will occur.

Features:
Smooth flowing text printing
Text History Viewer
Interactive menu
Non-Synchronized alpha fading of menus
